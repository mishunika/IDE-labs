Conclusions
-----------
This is my first mobile application written for iOS.
I enjoyed very much the process of creation of a mobile application from scratch.
From the trends of the time we all realize that mobile applications and mobile devices have a almost exponential growth, so it is extremely useful to know at leas the basis of mobile programming.
Of course, any type of knowledge may be a starting point for really big projects.
