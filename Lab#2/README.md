Conclusions
-----------
This laboratory work was quite interesting. For the first time I've developed an application using Qt framework.
The process of application creation was quite easy because I'm familiarized with the Python programming language, and the QTCreator creates for us an xml file that is easily convertible into python source code.
The division in multiple modules is very natural. My application consists of Visual part, Logic part and the link between them (a controller).
